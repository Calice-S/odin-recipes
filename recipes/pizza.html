        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>As I was looking out the window, reminiscing about the past year, the idea came to me to share my favorite New York style pizza 
        so others can feel the joy that I don't feel this year. If you're wondering why I don't feel in the spirits this christmas season
        is because my husband left me for the neighbor, I can hear them laughing as I type. My cat also left me, she gave me one last look and never came home from one of 
        her walks, I suspect she's also at the neighbor's house. Anyway, onto the pizza the real reason why you're here, not to hear my troubles.

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in bowl of food processor. Add water and olive oil. Run food processor until mixture forms ball that rides around the bowl above the blade, 
            about 15 seconds. Continue processing 15 seconds longer.</li>
            <li>Transfer dough ball to lightly floured surface and knead once or twice by hand until smooth ball is formed.
            Divide dough into three even portions and place each in a covered quart-sized deli container or in a zipper-lock freezer bag. 
            Place in refrigerator and allow to rise at least 1 day, and up to 5.
            </li>
            <li>At least two hours before baking, remove dough from refrigerator and shape into balls by gathering dough towards bottom and pinching shut. 
            Flour well and place each dough ball in a separate medium mixing bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and allow to rise at warm room temperature until roughly doubled in volume.
            </li>
            <li>
            One hour before baking, adjust oven rack with pizza stone to middle position and preheat oven to 500°F (260°C). 
            Turn single dough ball out onto lightly floured surface. Gently press out dough into rough 8-inch circle, leaving outer inch higher than the rest. 
            Gently stretch dough by draping over knuckles to form a 12- to 14-inch circle about 1/4-inch thick. Transfer to pizza peel.
            </li>
            <li>
            Spread approximately 2/3 cup sauce evenly over surface of crust, leaving 1/2- to 1-inch border along edge. Evenly spread 1/3 of cheese over sauce. 
            Slide pizza onto baking stone and bake until cheese is melted with some browned spots and crust is golden brown and puffed, 12 to 15 minutes. 
            Transfer to cutting board, slice, and serve immediately. Repeat with remaining two dough balls, remaining sauce, and remaining cheese.
            </li>
