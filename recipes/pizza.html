    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>As I was looking out the window, reminiscing about the past year, the idea came to me to share my favorite New York style pizza 
        so others can feel the joy that I don't feel this year. If you're wondering why I don't feel in the spirits this christmas season
        is because my husband left me for the neighbor, I can hear them laughing as I type. My cat also left me, she gave me one last look and never came home from one of 
        her walks, I suspect she's also at the neighbor's house. Anyway, onto the pizza the real reason why you're here, not to hear my troubles.
    </p>
